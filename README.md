# UART-Transmitter-and-Receiver

This project is about transmitting data from an FPGA to a computer using a UART (universal asynchronous serial transmitter). I created RTL code for FPGA UART transmitter, enabling asynchronous serial communication. For the compiling of the RTL code and the implementation of data transmission, Intel Quartus Prime and Altera DE2-115 Educationand Development board with Cyclone IV FPGA device used. I Compiled and validated the code using Intel Quartus Prime and utilized the Altera DE2-115 boardâ€™s Cyclone IV FPGA for robust data transmission.
